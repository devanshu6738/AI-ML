# 🤖 AI & ML Projects Repository  

Welcome to my **AI & Machine Learning** projects repo!  
This repository is a collection of my learning journey and implementations in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and AI applications**.  
My goal is to build impactful ML systems that solve **real-world problems** and prepare myself for **Google-level opportunities** 🚀.

## 📌 Roadmap  

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundations  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- Statistics & Linear Algebra basics  

### 🔹 Phase 2: Machine Learning  
- Regression, Classification, Clustering  
- Feature Engineering & Model Evaluation  

### 🔹 Phase 3: Deep Learning  
- ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM  
- Transfer Learning  

### 🔹 Phase 4: NLP  
- Text Preprocessing  
- Transformers (BERT, GPT)  

### 🔹 Phase 5: Recommender Systems  
- Collaborative & Content-based filtering  

### 🔹 Phase 6: Real-World Integration  
- APIs, Geolocation (Google Maps API)  
- Model Deployment (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)

## 🚀 Projects Included  

1. **Healthcare Assistant** – Disease prediction using ML & DL.  
2. **AI Resume Screener (ATS)** – NLP model to rank resumes for job roles.  
3. **Fraud Detection System** – Detects fraudulent transactions.  
4. **Personalized Learning Recommender** – Suggests courses/resources.  
5. **AI Shopping Reminder Assistant (Google Maps + AI)** –  
   My unique project idea: Users add shopping lists → system uses **geolocation + AI** to remind them when near relevant stores.
